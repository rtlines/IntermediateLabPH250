\chapter{Validation of Ohm's Law}
What physicists do is to try to understand how the universe works. To do
this we use the Scientific Method. And what makes the Scientific Method
different from philosophy is the use of experimentation to verify our ideas.
So in a physics lab class, we need to test ideas about how the universe
works. We call these ideas \textquotedblleft mental
models\textquotedblright\ or just \textquotedblleft
models.\textquotedblright\ We have been using one of these models in making
voltage measuring devices already. It was called Ohm's law. Let's start out
by testing Ohm's law to see if it really works.

\section{Ohm's Law Revisited}

We learned several labs ago that voltage and current are linearly related to
each other. This is what we would call a \emph{model}, a mental
understanding of how part of the universe works. Usually in physics we
distil the model into an equation . We call this equation a law. In this
case, Ohm's law. 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V=IR
\end{equation*}%
where $R$ is the slope of the $\Delta V$ vs. $I$ curve. We can see the model
relationship between $\Delta V$ and $I$ reflected in the equation. Note that
being a \textquotedblleft law\textquotedblright\ doesn't mean the equation
is always true. The word \textquotedblleft law\textquotedblright\ generally
implies that the equation is true at least some of the time, but really it
is telling us we have distilled our model into math.

We might plot our equation to show the $\Delta V$ vs. $I$ relationship.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=2.4898in,height=1.6535in]{PH4CAV2O}
\end{figure}But as scientists, we should ask,
does our model work for all materials? What if we graphed $\Delta V$ vs $I$
for some device and found a graph that looks like this?\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=%
2.2606in,height=1.5177in]{PH4CAV2P}
\end{figure}Such a device would \emph{not}
follow Ohm's law. We would say that such a device is \emph{nonohmic}.

Today we will test our model by taking $\Delta V$ and $I\ $measurements and
seeing if the equation $\Delta V=IR$ describes the data well. Of course,
this means we need to measure two things at once with our Arduino. We need
both $\Delta V$ and $I.$ But this isn't a problem because our Arduninos have
five analog inputs. So we just need to have one measurement attached to,
say, pin A0 and another to, say, pin A1. Of course both will need to be
connected to GND as the second measurement because $\Delta V$ measurements
take two leads.

But wait if we are testing Ohm's law, we don't want two $\Delta V$
measurements, we want $\Delta V$ and $I.$ How do we get $I$ measured by an
Arduino?

\subsection{Measuring current with our Arduino}

Arduinos and other DAQs only measure voltages. Let's review how we measure
the voltage across a resistor, and then review how to turn that voltage
measurement into a current measurement.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=3.2785in,height=1.6449in]{PH4CAV2Q}
\end{figure}We put the two leads of a
voltmeter (shown as a circle with a $\Delta V$\ in it) on either side of the
resistor that we are testing. If the voltmeter is our Arduino, the leads on
the side of the resister connected to the positive side of the battery
should go to A0 and the lead connected to the negative side of the battery
should be connected to GND. This is all what an Arduino (or any other DAQ)
can do.

To measure a current with our Arduino we have to somehow turn that current
into a voltage. This is true of most measurements we will do. We need to
turn temperature, or humidity, or magnetic field, or light intensity into a
voltage. Turning magnetic field into a voltage is a little tricky, but we
already know all we need to know to handle current.

To turn a current into a voltage, think of Ohm's law again.%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{s}=IR_{s}
\end{equation*}%
we can solve for $I$%
\begin{equation*}
I=\frac{\Delta V_{s}}{R_{s}}
\end{equation*}%
so if we add a new resistor, $R_{s}$ to the circuit, \begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=3.7395in,height=%
2.7423in]{PH4CAV2R}
\end{figure}and measure the voltage across
that circuit, we will be able to calculate the current.

Of course, if $R_{s}$ is very large, then $R_{s},$ itself, will slow down
the current. So we want to choose a $R_{s}$ that is much less than $%
R_{test}. $%
\begin{equation*}
R_{s}\ll R_{test}
\end{equation*}

But so long as this is true, our $R_{s}$ won't change the current much, and
since we know $R_{s}$ we know the current 
\begin{equation*}
I=\frac{\Delta V_{s}}{R_{s}}
\end{equation*}%
We have turned our current measurement into a voltage measurement!

\subsection{Actually making an Arduino measure current}

This idea is great, but let's talk a little bit about how to wire this dual
measurement. Think again about our two voltage measurements, $\Delta V$ and $%
\Delta V_{s}.$ Each $\Delta $ implies two measurements. That means we need a
total of four measurements to make this work! Let's see where these
measurements would be on our circuit diagram.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=4.2583in,height=3.1185in]{PH4CAV2S}
\end{figure}By drawing the diagram, we
realize that we can create both $\Delta V$ measurements with only three
individual voltage measurements because the voltage at point 2 and the
voltage at point 3 should be the same. So we could wire our circuit like
this:\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=4.2004in,height=2.8928in]{PH4CAV2T}
\end{figure}and of course we need to wire the
negative pole of the battery or power supply to the GND pin. Then our two
voltage difference measurements will be formed from 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta V &=&V_{A2}-V_{A1} \\
\Delta V_{s} &=&V_{A1}-V_{A0}
\end{eqnarray*}

If we keep our voltage from our battery or power supply in the $0\unit{V}$
to $+5\unit{V}$ range, then we can use our simple voltmeter sketch. We do
need to modify it to take three different voltage measurements. And we need
to add the math to make $\Delta V_{s}$ into $I.$ We could even modify this
so that our code would report out 
\begin{equation*}
R=\frac{\Delta V}{I}
\end{equation*}%
and we might as well. Here is an example sketch.

\subsubsection{Choosing shunt resistors}

It's harder than you might think to choose a good shunt resistor. The shunt
resistor resistance shouldn't be big enough to cause too much error in our $%
\Delta V$ measurement for the resistor we want to measure. Nor should it be
so large that it effects the current much. But suppose we find the smallest
resistor that we can, say, $10\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}.$ Surely that will not affect the actual $\Delta V$ or $I$ measurements.
But still, we may have a problem. Let's consider an actual circuit to see
why.

Suppose we have a circuit where the input voltage from the power supply is $%
\Delta V_{ps}=2\unit{V}$ and our test resistor is $R=5000\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}.$ And suppose we try to use $R_{s}=10\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}.$ \begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=4.6527in,height=2.9265in]{PH4CAV2U}
\end{figure}

The two resistors together are a voltage divider. We recognize this from our
previous labs. So we expect the voltage drop across each resistor to sum to
the voltage given by the power supply%
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{ps}=\Delta V_{R}+\Delta V_{s}
\end{equation*}%
and we know the current will be the same in the entire circuit. We can use
Ohm's law to find the current.

\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{ps}=IR_{total}
\end{equation*}%
so that 
\begin{eqnarray*}
I &=&\frac{\Delta V_{ps}}{R_{total}} \\
&=&\frac{\Delta V_{ps}}{R+R_{s}}
\end{eqnarray*}

Now we can find the voltage drop across just $R_{s}$%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta V_{s} &=&IR_{s} \\
&=&\left( \frac{\Delta V_{ps}}{R+R_{s}}\right) R_{s}
\end{eqnarray*}%
and let's put in numbers%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta V_{s} &=&\left( \frac{2\unit{V}}{5000\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}+10\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}}\right) \left( 10\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\right) \\
&=&3.\,\allowbreak 992\times 10^{-3}\unit{V} \\
&=&3.\,\allowbreak 992\unit{mV}
\end{eqnarray*}%
Remember that for our simple voltmeter, 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{\min }=\frac{5\unit{V}}{1024}=4.\,\allowbreak 88\unit{mV}
\end{equation*}%
and this is larger than $\Delta V_{s}$ so once we use our Arduino analog to
digital converter (ADC), $\Delta V_{s}$ will appear to be zero! Our current
meter that we built will say our current measurement will be zero even
thought there is a current flowing. That is a 100\% error!

We might try to improve things by increasing the power supply voltage. Even
if we increased the voltage from the power supply to, say, $5\unit{V}$ (our
maximum) we would only have 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta V_{s} &=&\left( \frac{5\unit{V}}{5000\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}+10\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}}\right) \left( 10\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\right) \\
&=&9\,.98\unit{mV}
\end{eqnarray*}%
We should compare this value to our ADC minimum detectable value 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\Delta V_{s}}{\Delta V_{\min }}=N
\end{equation*}%
the number of ADC units that will be used. We can see that for $R_{s}=10%
\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}$ 
\begin{equation*}
N=\frac{9\,.98\unit{mV}}{4.\,\allowbreak 88\unit{mV}}=2
\end{equation*}%
ADC units. With our entire value of $\Delta V_{s}$ split into only two
numbers our uncertainty in our $\Delta V_{s}$ would be something like $50\%.$
That won't make a very good current measurement

Suppose instead, we use $R_{s}=170\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}.$ This is much bigger, so it will affect the voltage measurement of the
test resistor a little. But in the end will work better. If we set our power
supply back to $\Delta V_{ps}=2\unit{V}$ the $R_{s}=170\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}$ gives. 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta V_{s} &=&\left( \frac{2\unit{V}}{5000\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}+170\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}}\right) \left( 170\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\right) \\
&=&65.\,\allowbreak 764\unit{mV}
\end{eqnarray*}%
This would give 
\begin{equation*}
N=\frac{65.\,\allowbreak 764\unit{mV}}{4.\,\allowbreak 88\unit{mV}}%
=13.\,\allowbreak 476
\end{equation*}%
or about $13$ ADC units spread across our $65.\,\allowbreak 764\unit{mV}.$
Then each of our ADC units would be worth 
\begin{equation*}
\delta \Delta V_{s}=\frac{65.\,\allowbreak 764\unit{mV}}{13}=5.\,\allowbreak
1\unit{mV}
\end{equation*}%
This is very near the $\Delta V_{\min }=$ $4.88\,\allowbreak \unit{mV}$
value, but a little bit higher. If $\delta \Delta V_{s}$ from our
calculation is larger than $\delta V_{\min ,}$ then we have to use the
larger value as our uncertainty in $\Delta V_{s}.$ So we would say $\delta
\Delta V_{s}=5.\,\allowbreak 1\unit{mV}.$ But still this is not a terrible
error. 
\begin{equation*}
100\times \frac{5.\,\allowbreak 058\,8\unit{mV}}{65.\,\allowbreak 764\unit{mV%
}}=7.\,\allowbreak 7\%
\end{equation*}%
This is much better than $50\%$ or $100\%$ error. You might guess that we
can do a little better by trying other resistance values. And you would be
right. But if you only need an $8\%$ error, this value would be fine.

Our stand-alone meters have lots of shunt resistors inside of them. You are
changing shunt resistors when you change the dial setting, trying to balance
these errors. By changing shunt resistors in our circuit we are doing the
same thing as turning the dial on the current settings of a multimeter.

\subsection{Finding Uncertainty in a calculated value}

In the last section I\ gave errors in $\Delta V_{s},$ but didn't finish the
error in the current, $I.$ Of course, since we had to calculate the current,
we also need to find the uncertainty in our current using error propagation.
Fortunately we \textquotedblleft remember\textquotedblright\ how to do this
from PH150. We use our basic form for standard error propagation. If we have
a function $f\left( x,y,z\right) $ then the uncertainty in $f$ would be 
\begin{equation*}
\delta f=\sqrt{\left( \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right) \left(
\delta x\right) \right) ^{2}+\left( \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}%
\right) \left( \delta y\right) \right) ^{2}+\left( \left( \frac{\partial f}{%
\partial z}\right) \left( \delta z\right) \right) ^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
In our current case, our function $f$ is the current $I$ and it is a
function of $\Delta V_{s}$ and $R_{s}$ 
\begin{equation*}
f=I=\frac{\Delta V_{s}}{R_{s}}
\end{equation*}%
so we will have an uncertainty like this%
\begin{equation*}
\delta I=\sqrt{\left( \left( \frac{\partial I}{\partial \Delta V_{s}}\right)
\left( \delta \Delta V_{s}\right) \right) ^{2}+\left( \left( \frac{\partial I%
}{\partial R_{s}}\right) \left( \delta R_{s}\right) \right) ^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
and we can find the partial derivatives%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial I}{\partial \Delta V_{s}}=\frac{1}{R_{s}}
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial I}{\partial R_{s}}=-\frac{\Delta V_{s}}{R_{s}^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
so we have 
\begin{equation*}
\delta I=\sqrt{\left( \left( \frac{1}{R_{s}}\right) \left( \delta \Delta
V_{s}\right) \right) ^{2}+\left( \left( -\frac{\Delta V_{s}}{R_{s}^{2}}%
\right) \left( \delta R_{s}\right) \right) ^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
Let's try this for our example in the last section. We have $\Delta
V_{s}=9\,.98\unit{mV}$ and $R_{s}=170\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}.$ We know that $\delta \Delta V_{s}=$ $5.\,\allowbreak 058\,8\unit{mV}$
and our resistors are only good to $1\%$ so that would be $\delta R_{S}=1.7%
\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}$%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\delta I &=&\sqrt{\left( \left( \frac{1}{170\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}}\right) \left( 5.\,\allowbreak 058\,8\unit{mV}\right) \right) ^{2}+\left(
\left( -\frac{65.\,\allowbreak 764\unit{mV}}{\left( 170\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\right) ^{2}}\right) \left( 1.7\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\right) \right) ^{2}} \\
&=&3.\,\allowbreak 000\,8\times 10^{-5}\unit{A}
\end{eqnarray*}

This looks small. Is it a good uncertainty? We can't tell until we compare
it to our expected current. We expect for our example 
\begin{eqnarray*}
I &=&\frac{\Delta V_{ps}}{R} \\
&=&\frac{2\unit{V}}{5000\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}} \\
&=&\allowbreak 0.000\,4\unit{A} \\
&=&4\times 10^{4}\unit{A}
\end{eqnarray*}%
so the fractional uncertainty in the current will be 
\begin{equation*}
100\frac{3.\,\allowbreak 000\,8\times 10^{-5}\unit{A}}{4\times 10^{4}\unit{A}%
}=7.\,\allowbreak 502\%
\end{equation*}%
This still isn't great, it's about what we got for the error in $\delta
\Delta V_{s}$ (but it's better than $50\%$). We might be able to do better.
But if $8\%$ is OK for our application, then we stop here!

Let's try to figure out what the biggest contributor to our uncertainty
might be. To do this we look at the terms in our uncertainty calculation
separately%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left( \left( \frac{1}{R_{s}}\right) \left( \delta \Delta V_{s}\right)
\right) ^{2} &=&\left( \left( \frac{1}{170\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}}\right) \left( 5.\,\allowbreak 058\,8\unit{mV}\right) \right)
^{2}=\allowbreak 8.\,\allowbreak 855\,2\times 10^{-10}\unit{A}^{2} \\
\left( \left( -\frac{\Delta V_{s}}{R_{s}^{2}}\right) \left( \delta
R_{s}\right) \right) ^{2} &=&\left( \left( -\frac{65.\,\allowbreak 764\unit{%
mV}}{\left( 170\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\right) ^{2}}\right) \left( 1.7\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}.\right) \right) ^{2}=\allowbreak 1.\,\allowbreak 496\,5\times 10^{-11}%
\unit{A}^{2}
\end{eqnarray*}%
The first term is about sixty times the second. So to make an improvement we
would want to first concentrate on the first term. We could change our $%
\delta \Delta V_{s}$ or change our $R_{s}$ value. Changing $\Delta V_{s}$ is
harder than changing $R_{s}.$ Maybe we could even make $R_{s}$ a little
bigger to improve our current measurement. \emph{Notice that this was not
the obvious solution!} At first it seemed that smaller $R_{s}$ values would
give better uncertainties. But after doing the uncertainty calculations, we
find that there is an optimal range for $R_{s}.$ Big $R_{s}$ is still bad,
but very small $R_{s}$ is also bad. You have to do the math to find this out.

\subsubsection{Iterate to find an optimal value}

Since there is an $R_{s}$ in the bottom of both terms in our current
uncertainty, let's try changing the $R_{s}$ value and see if the uncertainty
gets better. We have to start all the way back at the top with $\Delta
V_{s}. $ We will have to go through all our calculations again! A
spreadsheet or symbolic math processor might be a good way to go so you
aren't putting the same things in your calculator over and over.

We start by finding the current in the circuit

\begin{equation*}
I=\left( \frac{\Delta V_{ps}}{R+R_{s}}\right)
\end{equation*}%
Then an estimate for $\Delta V_{s}$ across the shunt resistor would be%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta V_{s} &=&IR_{s} \\
&=&\left( \frac{\Delta V_{ps}}{R+R_{s}}\right) R_{s}
\end{eqnarray*}%
and then the number of ADC units we used will be 
\begin{equation*}
N_{ADC}=\frac{\Delta V_{s}}{\Delta V_{\min }}
\end{equation*}%
rounded to the smallest integer, which gives a new estimate of our
uncertainty in $\Delta V_{s}$ 
\begin{equation*}
\delta \Delta V_{s}=\frac{\Delta V_{s}}{N_{ADC}}
\end{equation*}%
and now we need can find the uncertainty in $I$

\begin{equation*}
\delta I=\sqrt{\left( \left( \frac{1}{R_{s}}\right) \left( \delta \Delta
V_{s}\right) \right) ^{2}+\left( \left( -\frac{\Delta V_{s}}{R_{s}^{2}}%
\right) \left( \delta R_{s}\right) \right) ^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
and its fractional uncertainty%
\begin{equation*}
f_{I}=\frac{dI}{I}
\end{equation*}

As you can see, it is probably best to put all this in a symbolic package
(like Mathmatica or Maple, or Sage, or whatever your favorite symbolic math
processor might be). That way, you can change values of, say, $R_{s}$ and $%
\Delta V_{s}$ without redoing everything. At least consider using a
spreadsheet program or even in Python!.

Let's try this once more with $R_{s}=500\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}$ just to see what would happen.

\begin{eqnarray*}
I &=&\left( \frac{2\unit{V}}{5000\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}+500\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}}\right) \\
&=&3.\,\allowbreak 636\,4\times 10^{-4}\unit{A}
\end{eqnarray*}%
so%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta V_{s} &=&IR_{s} \\
&=&\left( \frac{2\unit{V}}{5000\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}+500\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}}\right) \left( 500\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\right) \\
&=&0.181\,82\unit{V}
\end{eqnarray*}%
and then the number of ADC units we used will be 
\begin{equation*}
N_{ADC}=\frac{0.181\,82\unit{V}}{4.\,\allowbreak 88\unit{mV}}%
=37.\,\allowbreak 258
\end{equation*}%
which gives a new estimate of our uncertainty in $\Delta V_{s}$ 
\begin{equation*}
\delta \Delta V_{s}=\frac{0.181\,82\unit{V}}{37}=4.\,\allowbreak
914\,1\times 10^{-3}\unit{V}
\end{equation*}%
and now we need can find the uncertainty in $I.$ We will need $\delta
R_{s}=500\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\times 0.01=\allowbreak 5.0\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}$

\begin{equation*}
\delta I=\sqrt{\left( \left( \frac{1}{500\unit{%

%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}}\right) \left( \delta \Delta V_{s}\right) \right) ^{2}+\left( \left( -%
\frac{\Delta V_{s}}{\left( 500\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\right) ^{2}}\right) \left( \delta R_{s}\right) \right) ^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\delta I &=&\sqrt{\left( \left( \frac{1}{500\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}}\right) \left( 4.\,\allowbreak 914\,1\times 10^{-3}\unit{V}\right) \right)
^{2}+\left( \left( -\frac{0.181\,82\unit{V}}{\left( 500\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\right) ^{2}}\right) \left( 5.0\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\right) \right) ^{2}} \\
&=&1.\,\allowbreak 047\,9\times 10^{-5}\unit{A}
\end{eqnarray*}
and its fractional uncertainty%
\begin{equation*}
f_{I}=100\times \frac{1.\,\allowbreak 047\,9\times 10^{-5}\unit{A}}{%
3.\,\allowbreak 636\,4\times 10^{-4}\unit{A}}=2.\,\allowbreak 881\,7\%
\end{equation*}
This was a bit of an improvement! We could continue to iterate. I had my
computer do this for $R=5000\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}$ and $\Delta V_{ps}=2\unit{V}$ I asked it to plot $f_{I}$ as a function of 
$R_{s}$ \begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=4.4997in,height=1.4165in]{PH4CAV2V}
\end{figure}Notice that after about $500\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}$ we are not going to get much of an improvement. So our choice of $%
R_{s}=500\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}$ seems good for this situation. Once you have a symbolic package or
spreadsheet version of this calculation, picking different shunt resistors
becomes fairly easy.

We should check, though. What did our $500\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}$ resistor do to our $\Delta V$ measurement? We found our current in the
circuit to be 
\begin{equation*}
I=3.\,\allowbreak 636\,4\times 10^{-4}\unit{A}
\end{equation*}%
and our test resistor is $5000\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}$ so 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta V_{test}=\left( 3.\,\allowbreak 636\,4\times 10^{-4}\unit{A}\right)
\left( 5000\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\right) =1.\,\allowbreak 818\,2\unit{V}
\end{equation*}%
We know the power supply was providing $\Delta V_{ps}=2\unit{V}$. So we have
introduced an error. We can find the percent difference 
\begin{equation*}
\left( 100\right) \frac{1.\,\allowbreak 818\,2\unit{V}-2\unit{V}}{%
1.\,\allowbreak 818\,2\unit{V}}=-9.\,\allowbreak 998\,9\%
\end{equation*}%
which means the $\Delta V$ measurement will be $10\%$ low due to our
inserting the shunt resistance. If we can live with a $10\%$ error, then we
are fine. If not, it is back to iteration to find a better shunt resistance.

Of course, so far we have just found uncertainty in $\Delta V$ and $I$.
These are the uncertainties in our measuring devices that we built. Since
you are the manufacturer of these devices, you have had to calculate what
their uncertainties will be. When we design our own measuring devices, we
always have to do this. Of course you could have built the devices and then
watched the output to see where the digits fluctuate like we did with our
stand-alone multimeters. But the risk is that it might take a long time to
find a value for each part of our device that works together with the other
parts, and in the mean time we might burn up our equipment if we don't plan
for what we want first. You can check your uncertainty calculations by
looking at the fluctuation of the digits to see if we are right (or if some
other uncertainty factor has crept in that we haven't handled yet).

When we started this lab we said we were testing Ohm's law, and we wanted to
find $R_{test}$ uncertainty $\delta R_{test}$ to see if Ohm's law really
works. In finding the uncertainty in our measuring devices we haven't found $%
\delta R_{test}.$ We will review a different way to do that analysis.

\subsection{Using statistics to calculate uncertainty}

By now in a experimental design, I am usually at my tolerance limit for
calculating uncertainties. You might ask, can't we get our powerful
computers to help us out a little bit with finding the uncertainty? After
all, we went to all the trouble to get the data on the computer. The answer
is, yes!

Let's suppose we have done our experiment and we have some data that look
like this: \begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=3.563in,height=2.7345in]{PH4CAV2W}
\end{figure}

This looks pretty good. It seems to be sort of linear. We might guess from
this that Ohm's law is begin obeyed. But we want $R_{test}$ and $R_{test}$
is the slope of this line. We could calculate $R_{test}$ from each pair of $%
\Delta V$ and $I$ points and find it's uncertainty using standard error
propagation. But it seems that it would be better to take all the points
into our analysis to find $R_{test}.$ More data should give us a better
estimate for $R_{test}.$ Back in PH150 you may have done such a thing using
a \emph{curve fit}. In the next figure, a curve fit is shown for the data
from the last figure. \begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=3.966in,height=3.0441in]{PH4CAV2X}
\end{figure}

Notice that I\ performed this curve fit in MicroSoft Excel, but if you are a
great Python programer you could do this directly in Python. You could also
do this in LoggerPro or many other data analysis programs. From the curve
fit equation we can see that we have a slope of $1092.9.$ Since our graph
has $\Delta V$ on the vertical axis and $I$ on the horizontal axis we
recognize 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta V &=&R_{test}I+0 \\
y &=&mx+b
\end{eqnarray*}%
that $R_{test}$ must be the slope. In the data above the we can see that the
resistance is a little more than $1092\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}$ because that is the slope of our fit line. But we know we need an
uncertainty along with this nominal value. Can we get the computer to do
this as well?

The answer is, of course, Yes! And that will save us a bunch of math! In
some data analysis programs this is easy. LoggerPro, for example, just gives
you the uncertainty in $m$ and $b.$ Excel does not. If you want to use
LoggerPro, that is fine. If you know how to do this in Python, go ahead.
But, if you want to use Excel, let's see how to find the uncertainty.

We will use the \texttt{linst} function in Excel. To find this, select the 
\emph{insert function tool.}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=3.7395in,height=3.0018in]{PH4CAV2Y}
\end{figure}This will bring up a dialog box
that allows you to select functions. We want the linst function and it is
categorized under \emph{statistical}, so in the category drop down box 
\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=4.1252in,height=3.154in]{PH4CAV2Z}
\end{figure}Then in the \emph{Select a
function:} box you should find \texttt{LINST} in the list.\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=%
3.9738in,height=3.0277in]{PH4CAV30}
\end{figure}%
When you choose \texttt{LINST}, another dialog box will open.\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=%
4.7288in,height=2.2554in]{PH4CAV31}
\end{figure}
It will ask you for your $y$-values and your $x$-values. It asks for a
Constant, but leave that input blank. It also asks if we want statistics. We
do, so fill this in with the word \textquotedblleft TRUE\textquotedblright\
in all caps.

When you click on OK, you will get a number in a spreadsheet cell. That is
good, It should be our slope. But we want the uncertainty in that slope. To
do this highlight the cells near the slope value. The region needs to be two
columns by five rows. \begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=2.7172in,height=2.7596in]{PH4CAV32}
\end{figure}With the region highlighted,
click the formula in the formula bar with your mouse.\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=3.128in,height=%
2.8262in]{PH4CAV33}
\end{figure} It should light up parts of your
spreadsheet. \begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=4.2445in,height=2.3212in]{PH4CAV34}
\end{figure}Type CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER all at the
same time. This will fill in the region with statistics on our data. The top
left cell in our region is still the slope, but now right under this slope
is the uncertainty in the slope. We also have in the top, right cell the $y$%
-intercept and below it the $y$-intercept uncertainty. \begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=6.3797in%
,height=2.0721in]{PH4CAW35}
\end{figure}

There are other numbers that are useful, but for now the two rows have given
us what we needed. We have the slope, $m,$ the $y$-intercept, $b,$ and their
uncertainties. For the data in the figures, we would have 
\begin{equation*}
R_{test}=1100\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\pm 100\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}
\end{equation*}

This was a little tricky, but was far less mathematical work than doing the
uncertainty for every $\left( I,\Delta V\right) $ pair. We will often use
this technique to find uncertainty.

Also notice that in this analysis technique, we can afford some error in our 
$\Delta V$ and $I$ values. So maybe a $9\%$ error (like we found in one of
our instrument desigs) is not so bad. We may not have to work too hard to
get a wonderful choice of shunt resistor if we are going to use many data
points and the power of statistics to analyze the data in the end!

\subsection{Philosophical warning}

There was a lot to this reading. We talked about designing and building an
instrument. We used some physics, Ohm's law, in our design process. Then we
tested a physical model, Ohm's law, with our instrument. All these were good
things, but maybe you wondered along the way if it is acceptable to test
Ohm's law with an instrument that depends on Ohm's law. And the answer is a
big NO!

This lab is practice, but it is imperfect practice. We do know that Ohm's
law works, so we are going to use it in designing instruments. But you
really need a different instrument, one that does not depend on Ohm's law,
to test Ohm's law in a credible way. In next week's lab, we will test a
different physical model with the same basic instrument that we build today.
The instrument will depend on Ohm's law, but the new physical model must not
if the experiment is to be valid.

\section{Proposals}

It's time to start thinking of what experiment you and your group will
design. You are required to write a proposal for this experiment. \ This is
a document that is intended to persuade someone (your professor, funding
agency, yourself, etc.) that you should be given the resources and support
to perform the experiment. The proposal consists of the following parts:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Statement of the experimental problem

\item Procedures and anticipated difficulties

\item Proposed analysis and expected results

\item Preliminary List of equipment needed
\end{enumerate}

Each of these are discussed below.

\subsection{Statement of the experimental problem}

This is a physics class, so our experiment should be a physics experiment.
The job of an experimental physicist is to test physics theory. So your
statement of the experimental problem should include what theory you are
testing and a brief, high level, overview of what you plan to do to test
this theory.

\subsection{Procedures and anticipated difficulties}

Hopefully, your reader will be so excited by the thought of you solving your
experimental problem that he or she will want to know the details of what
you plan to do. You should describe in some detail what you are planning. If
there are hard parts of the procedure, tell how you plan to get through them.

\subsection{Proposed analysis and expected results}

You might think this is unfair, how are you supposed to know what analysis
will be needed and what the results should be until you take the data? But
really you both can, and should, make a good plan for your data analysis and
figure out what your expected results should be. After all, you have a
theory your are testing! You can encapsulate that theory into a predictive
equation for your experiment. You can design your experimental apparatus,
and put in the numbers from your experimental design. From this you can
calculate what should be the outcome.

If you don't do this, you don't know what equipment you will need or how
sensitive that equipment needs to be. If you are trying to measure the size
of your text book, an odometer that only measures in whole miles may not be
the best choice of equipment. To know what you need, do the calculations in
advance.

You should also do the error analysis. You will want to predict the
uncertainty. A measurement of your text book length that is good to $\pm 3%
\unit{m}$ is not very satisfying in most cases. Uncertainty in your result
is governed by the uncertainty inherent in the measurements you will take.
The uncertainty calculation tells you what sensitivity you will need in your
measurement devices. Since you are choosing those measurement devices as
part of your proposal, and you are choosing the inputs to your model
equaiton (like the resistance and the capacitance in today's lab) you will
know how much uncertatinty they have, so you can do the calculation in
advance.

You should do all of this symbolically if you can, numerically if you must,
but almost never by hand (meaning not using your calculator) giving single
value results. Some measurements will come back poorer than you anticipated,
or some piece of equipment will be unavailable. You don't want to have to
redo all your calculations from scratch each time this happens. For example,
in the event of an equipment problem, your analysis tells you if another
piece of equipment is sufficiently sensitive, or if you need to find an
exact replacement. When I\ perform an analysis like this, try for a symbolic
equation for uncertainty. I\ like to program these equations into Scientific
Workplace, or Maple, or SAGE, or MathCAD, or whatever symbolic math
processor I\ have. Alternatevly, you could code it into Python. Then, as
actual measurements change, I\ instantly get new predictions. In the absence
of a symbolic package, a spreadsheet program will do fine. A numerical
program also is quick and easy to re-run with new numbers when no symbolic
answer is found.

\subsection{Preliminary List of equipment needed}

Once you have done your analysis, you are ready to list the equipment you
need and the sensitivity of the measurement equipment you need. Final
approval of the project and the ultimate success of your experiment depend
on the equipment you choose or are granted. You want to do a good job
analyzing so you know what you need, and a good job describing the
experiment so you are likely to have the equipment granted.

\subsection{Designing the Experiment}

Of course, as part of your proposal, you will have to design your
experiment. In PH150 we learned that to design an experiment we needed the
following steps. Some evidence of these steps should be found in your lab
notebook:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify the system to be examined. Identify the inputs and outputs.
Describe your system in your lab notebook.

\item Identify the model to be tested. Express the model in terms of an
equation representing a prediction of the measurement you will make. Record
this in your lab notebook.

\item Plan how you will know if you are successful in your experiment. Plan
graphs or other reporting devices. Record this in your lab notebook. This
usually requires you to calculate the predicted uncertainty and to evaluate
the relative size of the terms in the uncertainty equation (see below).

\item Rectify your equation if needed. Record this in your lab notebook.

\item Choose ranges of the variables. Record this in your lab notebook.

\item Plan the experimental procedure. Record this in your lab notebook.

\item Perform the experiment . Record this in your lab notebook (see next
section).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Using Uncertainty to refine experimental design.}

Suppose you plan to test our model for resistance from your PH220 text book.
The equation for resistance is 
\begin{equation*}
R=\rho \frac{\ell }{A}
\end{equation*}%
where $\rho $ is the resistivity, the material properties of the material
that makes wire or resistor have friction. The length of the wire or
resistor is $\ell $, and $A$ is the cross sectional area. We could find the
uncertainty in $R$%
\begin{equation*}
\delta R=\sqrt{\left( \frac{\partial R}{\partial \rho }\delta \rho \right)
^{2}+\left( \frac{\partial R}{\partial \ell }\delta \ell \right) ^{2}+\left( 
\frac{\partial R}{\partial A}\delta A\right) ^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
The first term in the square root is 
\begin{equation*}
\left( \frac{\partial R}{\partial \rho }\delta \rho \right) ^{2}=\left( 
\frac{\ell }{A}\delta \rho \right) ^{2}
\end{equation*}%
and the other two terms are 
\begin{equation*}
\left( \frac{\partial R}{\partial \ell }\delta \ell \right) ^{2}=\left( 
\frac{\rho }{A}\delta \ell \right) ^{2}
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
\left( \frac{\partial R}{\partial A}\delta A\right) ^{2}=\left( -\rho \frac{%
\ell }{A^{2}}\delta A\right) ^{2}
\end{equation*}

And suppose that our design is to have a copper wire with 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\rho &=&1.68\pm 0.03\times 10^{-8}\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\unit{m} \\
\ell &=&5.0\pm 0.1\unit{m} \\
A &=&5.0\times 10^{-10}\unit{m}^{2}\unit{m}^{2}
\end{eqnarray*}%
This would give a resistance of 
\begin{eqnarray*}
R_{new} &=&1.68\times 10^{-8}\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\unit{m}\frac{5\unit{m}}{5.0\times 10^{-10}\unit{m}^{2}} \\
&=&168.0\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}
\end{eqnarray*}%
We can calculate each of our terms from the $\delta R$ equation. 
\begin{equation*}
\left( \frac{\ell }{A}\delta \rho \right) ^{2}=\left( \frac{5\unit{m}}{%
5.0\times 10^{-10}\unit{m}^{2}}\left( 0.03\times 10^{-8}\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\unit{m}\right) \right) ^{2}=9.0\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}^{2}
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
\left( \frac{\rho }{A}\delta \ell \right) ^{2}=\left( \frac{1.68\times
10^{-8}\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\unit{m}}{5.0\times 10^{-10}\unit{m}^{2}}\left( 0.1\unit{m}\right) \right)
^{2}=11.\,\allowbreak 290\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}^{2}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
\left( -\rho \frac{\ell }{A^{2}}\delta A\right) ^{2}=\left( -\left(
1.68\times 10^{-8}\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\unit{m}\right) \frac{\left( 5\unit{m}\right) }{\left( 5.0\times 10^{-10}%
\unit{m}^{2}\right) ^{2}}\left( 0.1\times 10^{-9}\unit{m}^{2}\right) \right)
^{2}=1129.\,\allowbreak 0\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}^{2}
\end{equation*}

The overall uncertainty then would be%
\begin{equation*}
\delta R=\sqrt{9.0\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}^{2}+11.\,\allowbreak 290\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}^{2}+1129.\,\allowbreak 0\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}^{2}}=33.\,\allowbreak 901\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}
\end{equation*}%
So with this design we predict a fractional uncertainty of 
\begin{equation*}
\frac{33.\,\allowbreak 901\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}}{168.0\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}}=0.201\,79
\end{equation*}%
or a little over $20\%.$ This is not a great design. We would like a much
lower uncertainty, something that gives a fractional uncertainty more like $%
1\%.$ It is clear that the last term has the highest contribution to the
uncertainty, so this is the term that needs fixing. One method of fixing the
problem would be to increase $\delta A.$ We could try $1.0\pm 0.1\times
10^{-9}\unit{m}^{2}.$ In order to have the same resistance we will also have
to change the length of the wire from $10\unit{m}$ to $5\unit{m}$. 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\rho &=&1.68\pm 0.03\times 10^{-8}\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\unit{m} \\
\ell &=&10.0\pm 0.1\unit{m} \\
A &=&1.0\pm 0.1\times 10^{-9}\unit{m}^{2}
\end{eqnarray*}

Checking we see we do get the same resistance 
\begin{eqnarray*}
R &=&1.68\times 10^{-8}\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\unit{m}\frac{10\unit{m}}{1.0\times 10^{-9}\unit{m}^{2}} \\
&=&168\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}
\end{eqnarray*}%
But now for the last term we would get 
\begin{equation*}
\left( -\rho \frac{\ell }{A^{2}}\delta A\right) ^{2}=\left( -\left(
1.68\times 10^{-8}\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\unit{m}\right) \frac{\left( 10\unit{m}\right) }{\left( 1.0\times 10^{-9}%
\unit{m}^{2}\right) ^{2}}\left( 0.1\times 10^{-9}\unit{m}^{2}\right) \right)
^{2}=282.\,\allowbreak 24\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}^{2}
\end{equation*}%
which is better. But we have to check to make sure our design change didn't
cause a large rise in the other two terms. 
\begin{equation*}
\left( \frac{\ell }{A}\delta \rho \right) ^{2}=\left( \frac{10\unit{m}}{%
1.0\times 10^{-9}\unit{m}^{2}}\left( 0.03\times 10^{-8}\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\unit{m}\right) \right) ^{2}=9.0\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}^{2}
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
\left( \frac{\rho }{A}\delta \ell \right) ^{2}=\left( \frac{1.68\times
10^{-8}\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}\unit{m}}{1.0\times 10^{-9}\unit{m}^{2}}\left( 0.1\unit{m}\right) \right)
^{2}=2.8224\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}^{2}
\end{equation*}

The first term was hurt by our new design change, but not badly. So with the
new design the overall uncertainty would be 
\begin{equation*}
\delta R=\sqrt{9.0\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}^{2}+2.8224\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}^{2}+282.\,\allowbreak 24\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}^{2}}=17.\,\allowbreak 148\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}
\end{equation*}%
$\allowbreak $So with this new design we predict a fractional uncertainty of%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{17.\,\allowbreak 148\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}}{168.0\unit{%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}}=0.102\,07
\end{equation*}%
which is about $\allowbreak 10.\%.$ This is much better. From our
uncertainty terms, we can see that to do better we need to improve both the $%
\delta A$ term and the $\delta \ell $ terms because they are now about the
same size. The terms in our uncertainty calculation tell us how to modify
our experimental design.

There is a refinement we could make to our process. really there are no area
measurement devices available, so what we would do is measure the diameter
of the wire and calculate the area.%
\begin{equation*}
A=\frac{1}{4}\pi D^{2}
\end{equation*}%
we could find $\delta A$ by using our propagation of uncertainty equation
again, or we could modify our resistance equation so that it is in terms of
what we actually measure.%
\begin{equation*}
R=\rho \frac{4\ell }{\pi D^{2}}
\end{equation*}%
and calculate our uncertainty in terms of $\rho ,$ $\ell ,$ and $D.$ That is
preferred and usually less work. The general rule is to express your model
equation in terms of what you will actually measure before you calculate the
uncertainty terms.

The moral of this long story is that we must calculate the uncertainty \emph{%
as part of the design process}. It is probably best to use a symbolic math
processor or at lease a spreadsheet so that as the design changes your
uncertainty estimate will change too without having to manually recalculate
it.

\section{Lab Assignment}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Build the instrument

\begin{enumerate}
\item Choose a test resistor in the $1\unit{k%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}$ to $10\unit{k%
%TCIMACRO{\U{3a9}}%
%BeginExpansion
\Omega%
%EndExpansion
}$ range and a shunt resistor. You will have to check your values using the
math we discussed above to make sure they will work. If your first shunt
resistor choice works, use it. If not, iterate until you have a shunt
resistance that will work.

\item Modify your voltmeter sketch to measure both the voltage and the
current. (Check the voltage, currents, and their uncertainties with the
serial monitor to make sure things seem good).

\item Build your voltmeter and ammeter so your Arduino is taking $\left(
I,\Delta V\right) $ pares and reporting them. Reporting to the serial
monitor is fine for a start. \begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=1.8507in,height=0.9677in]{PH4CAW36}
\end{figure}if you based your sketch on the
simple voltmeter, make sure you don't use voltages outside the $0\unit{V}$
to $+5\unit{V}$ range! Include expected uncertainties for your $\Delta V$
and $I$ measurements.

\item Check your lab group's instruments to see if they work, and have your
lab group members check yours.
\end{enumerate}

\item Test Ohm's law

\begin{enumerate}
\item Take 10-15 measurements of $\Delta V$ and $I.$ For each $\Delta V$
measurement change the $\Delta V$ setting on the power supply a small amount
(don't go over $5\unit{V}$ if you are using the simple voltmeter!).

\item Plot voltage vs. current and fit a curve to the data.

\item Determine the resistance from this curve fit and its uncertainty.

\item Finally, determine if your results support the Ohm model for how
potential and current are related?

\item Compare your data and conclusions to the data and conclusions of your
lab group members. Have them look at your results as well.
\end{enumerate}

\item If you still have time, repeat part 2 for a diode. Do your results
support the Ohm model for how potential and current are related?

\item Could you have your Arduino sketch report the calculated uncertainties
for $\Delta V,$ $I,$ and $R?$ If you have time (you probably won't) give
this a try.
\end{enumerate}
